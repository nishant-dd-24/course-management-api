| `GET`    | `/enrollments/{id}`       | INSTRUCTOR | Get enrollments for a course |

---

### Pagination Response

All paginated endpoints return a consistent `PageResponse<T>` envelope:

```json
{
  "content": [...],
  "pageNumber": 0,
  "pageSize": 5,
  "totalElements": 18,
  "numberOfElements": 5,
  "totalPages": 4,
  "first": true,
  "last": false,
  "hasNext": true,
  "hasPrevious": false,
  "hasContent": true
}
```

---

## Request Pipeline

Every request passes through a three-stage filter chain before reaching the controller:

```
Client Request
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Trace Filter   │  Generates/propagates X-Trace-Id, stores in MDC
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Rate Limit Filter   │  Resolves identity, checks token bucket
└────────┬─────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   JWT Filter    │  Validates token, loads SecurityContext
│                 │  (skips /users/login and /users/register)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
    Controller
```

---

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented using **Bucket4j** (token bucket algorithm) with a **Caffeine** cache for bucket storage. Limits are resolved per-request based on two axes:

### Role-based limits (per minute)

| Role       | Requests/min |
|------------|--------------|
| ADMIN      | 100          |
| INSTRUCTOR | 50           |
| STUDENT    | 20           |
| Anonymous  | 10           |

### Endpoint-specific limits (per minute)

| Endpoint               | Limit |
|------------------------|-------|
| `POST /users/login`    | 5     |
| `POST /enrollments/**` | 10    |
| `GET /courses/**`      | 100   |
| All others             | 20    |

**Identity resolution:** When a valid JWT is present, the bucket key is `email:ROLE:normalizedPath:method`. For unauthenticated requests, the IP address is used as fallback. Path normalization replaces numeric IDs with `{id}` (e.g. `/courses/42` → `/courses/{id}`) to prevent per-ID bucket explosion.

**Response headers:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 20
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 17
Retry-After: 42        ← only on 429 responses
```

---

## Caching

Caching is applied at the **query service layer** using Spring's caching abstraction backed by **Caffeine**. The cache targets read-heavy operations on courses and enrollments.

### Cache key design

Keys are constructed by dedicated utility classes to ensure stability across requests:

```
title=java|active=true|instructorId=1|page=0|size=5|sort=id:ASC
```

This prevents cache misses from input formatting differences (e.g., `%java%` vs `java`) and includes all pagination/sort parameters.

### What is cached

Only **courses** and **users** are cached. Enrollment data is not cached directly, but enrollment mutations (enroll/unenroll) do affect the `enrolledStudents` field on the `Course` entity — so any enrollment change publishes an event that evicts the relevant course cache entries to prevent stale seat counts being served.

### Cache eviction

Eviction is handled via **domain events** published on mutating operations (create, update, deactivate, enroll, unenroll), keeping cache state consistent without manual cache management at the controller level.

### Key configuration

- `sync = true` on all cache definitions to prevent **cache stampede** under concurrent load
- Single global Caffeine config: **10 minute TTL** (write-based expiry), **10,000 max entries**, shared across all cache names

---

## Concurrency Control

Enrollment operations use **pessimistic write locking** (`PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`) via JPA to prevent race conditions when multiple students attempt to enroll in a course simultaneously. The course row is locked at the database level for the duration of the transaction, ensuring that the seat count read, comparison, and increment are atomic.

```java
@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
@Query("SELECT c FROM Course c WHERE c.id = :courseId AND c.isActive = true")
Optional<Course> findByIdForUpdate(@Param("courseId") Long courseId);
```

Note: the `isActive = true` filter means attempting to enroll in an inactive course results in a `404 Not Found` rather than a seat-full error.

A `DataIntegrityViolationException` catch provides an additional safety net at the database level for any duplicate enrollment attempts.

**Trade-off:** Slightly reduced throughput under high concurrent enrollment on the same course, in exchange for strict seat-count correctness.

---

## Observability

### Request tracing

`TraceFilter` runs first in the filter chain:

- Reads `X-Trace-Id` from the incoming request, or generates a new UUID if absent
- Stores the trace ID in MDC under the key `traceId`
- Propagates the trace ID back in the response via `X-Trace-Id`

Because `logstash-logback-encoder` is configured with `includeMdc=true`, the trace ID is automatically included in every JSON log entry for the duration of the request — no manual passing required.

### Structured JSON logging

Logging is configured via `logback-spring.xml` using `LogstashEncoder`. Every log line is emitted as a JSON object.

### Annotation-driven log instrumentation

Log instrumentation is handled through a dedicated `log` package with three layers:

**`@Loggable` (annotation)** — placed on any method to declare its logging intent. Supported fields:

| Field                | Description                                                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `action`             | Machine-readable action key written to MDC (e.g. `"DELETE_USER"`)              |
| `message`            | Human-readable log message; falls back to `action` if blank                    |
| `level`              | Log level — `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` (default: `INFO`)                 |
| `extras`             | SpEL expressions evaluated against method parameters (e.g. `"#request.email"`) |
| `extraKeys`          | MDC key names corresponding to each `extras` expression by index               |
| `includeCurrentUser` | When `true`, resolves the authenticated user and writes `currentUserId` to MDC |

**`LoggingAspect` (AOP)** — intercepts all `@Loggable`-annotated methods. On each invocation it populates MDC from the annotation metadata, calls the method, then adds `status` and `durationMs` before emitting the log line. MDC is always cleared in a `finally` block regardless of outcome.

**`LogUtil.log()` (inline helper)** — used directly inside method bodies for branch-level log points (e.g. duplicate email, password mismatch, role change) that cannot be expressed as a single method-entry annotation. Accepts action, message, and variadic key-value pairs; always clears MDC in its own `finally` block.

Together, the two approaches cover all log points without any `try/finally` boilerplate at the call site:

```java
// Method-entry log — declared via annotation
@Loggable(action = "DELETE_USER", level = WARN, includeCurrentUser = true,
          extras = {"#id"}, extraKeys = {"deletedUserId"})
public void deleteUser(Long id) { ... }

// Branch-level log — emitted inline
LogUtil.log(log, WARN, "LOGIN_FAILED", "Login failed",
            "reason", "INVALID_PASSWORD", "userId", user.getId());
```

### Log output

Below are real examples from a login request:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-04-06T12:29:54.909189587+05:30","@version":"1","message":"Login successful","logger":"com.nishant.coursemanagement.service.user.UserServiceImpl","thread":"http-nio-8080-exec-1","level":"INFO","level_value":20000,"traceId":"0eaaf0b2-9128-4872-a3a7-a3a6ec9b7459","path":"/users/login","action":"LOGIN_SUCCESS","method":"POST","userId":"22","clientIp":"0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1","app":"course-management"}

{"timestamp":"2026-04-06T12:29:54.924532492+05:30","@version":"1","message":"LOGIN_ATTEMPT","logger":"com.nishant.coursemanagement.log.aspect.LoggingAspect","thread":"http-nio-8080-exec-1","level":"INFO","level_value":20000,"traceId":"0eaaf0b2-9128-4872-a3a7-a3a6ec9b7459","path":"/users/login","method":"POST","durationMs":"143","clientIp":"0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1","status":"SUCCESS","app":"course-management"}

```

Key points about the log structure:

- `action` is the machine-readable key used for querying and alerting; `message` is the human-readable description
- `status` (`SUCCESS` / `FAILED`) and `durationMs` are added automatically by `LoggingAspect` on every `@Loggable`-annotated method
- `traceId`, `method`, `path`, and `clientIp` are set once by `TraceFilter` and are present on all log entries for the full request lifetime
- MDC fields appear as flat top-level keys in the JSON output alongside standard fields
- The `app` field is injected globally via `customFields` in `logback-spring.xml`
- `LogUtil.clear()` only removes the keys it added — it does not call `MDC.clear()` — so `traceId` and other request-scoped fields set by `TraceFilter` remain intact. `TraceFilter` itself calls `MDC.clear()` in its own `finally` block at the very end as the outermost filter.

## Error Handling

All errors are handled by a global `@ControllerAdvice` and return a consistent JSON structure.

The `errors` map is populated **only** for `@Valid` validation failures (`MethodArgumentNotValidException`), where it contains field-level messages. For all other error cases it is an empty `{}`.

### Dual 401/403 handling

Spring Security intercepts some auth failures before the request reaches the controller layer. Two dedicated handlers cover this:

- **`CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint`** — handles `401 Unauthorized` when Spring Security rejects a request due to a missing or invalid JWT, before it reaches the controller
- **`CustomAccessDeniedHandler`** — handles `403 Forbidden` when Spring Security blocks an authenticated user due to insufficient role, before it reaches the controller

The `GlobalExceptionHandler` covers the equivalent cases that do reach the controller (`UnauthorizedException`, `AuthorizationDeniedException`). Both paths use the same `ErrorResponseWriter`, so the JSON response shape is identical regardless of which layer catches the error.

## Design Decisions

### Why pessimistic over optimistic locking?

Enrollment is a write operation with a clear contention point — multiple students racing to claim the last seat in a course. Optimistic locking would require retry logic on version conflicts, adding complexity and unpredictable latency under load. Pessimistic locking (`PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`) gives a simpler, stronger guarantee by holding the row lock for the duration of the transaction.

**Trade-off:** Slightly reduced concurrency throughput under heavy enrollment load on the same course, in exchange for strict seat-count correctness.

---

### Why in-process rate limiting over Redis?

Bucket4j + Caffeine gives zero-latency limit checks with no external dependency. For a single-instance deployment, this is the right default. The design is structured so that switching to a Redis-backed `ProxyManager` requires only a configuration change.

**Trade-off:** Rate limit state resets on application restart and is not shared across instances.

---

### Why a custom `PageResponse` DTO?

Spring's `Page<T>` serialization is unstable and includes internal fields that change between versions. A custom `PageResponse<T>` gives a stable, documented contract for all paginated responses.

---

### Why split command and query services?

Each domain area (`UserService` / `UserQueryService`, etc.) separates read and write concerns, making caching and locking strategies easier to apply precisely. Query services are cache-eligible; command services manage eviction.

---

### Why two logging mechanisms (`@Loggable` + `LogUtil.log()`)?

`@Loggable` handles the method-entry log point — the single, unconditional emission that every method has. `LogUtil.log()` handles branch-level log points within the same method body (e.g. duplicate email detected, password mismatch, role change on update) that carry different `action` keys and context depending on the execution path. Using `@Loggable` alone for these would require either one annotation per branch (not possible) or encoding branching logic into SpEL (fragile). The two mechanisms are complementary: the annotation removes all `try/finally` boilerplate at method entry; the helper removes it at every inline call site.

## Roadmap

The following are needed before this project could be considered production-ready:

**Correctness & reliability**
- [ ] Unit and integration test coverage
- [ ] Advanced input validation and edge-case hardening

**Operability**
- [ ] Dockerization + `docker-compose` setup
- [ ] Prometheus metrics integration (Actuator already active)
- [ ] Swagger / OpenAPI documentation

**Scalability** *(current in-memory solutions break under horizontal scaling)*
- [ ] Distributed rate limiting via Redis + Bucket4j `ProxyManager`
- [ ] Distributed caching (Caffeine → Redis or two-level)
- [ ] Database indexing and query analysis for larger datasets

**Observability**
- [ ] OpenTelemetry distributed tracing integration
- [ ] API abuse detection and alerting
